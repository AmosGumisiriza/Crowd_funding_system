            We transform ideas into reality. It’s where fundraisers share new
            visions for creative work with the communities that will come
            together to fund them.
            <br />
            No matter what, fundraisers always control how the work comes
            together—no 100-page grant applications, no donors demanding you
            modify your message, no last-minute edits from investors. When
            donors chip in funding and help spread the word, they too become
            part of these independent works.

              Yes! That's part of what makes CCDG special. If a project
              isn't successfully funded, no one pays anything.

              The project will be added to the list of backings on your profile
              page, but the amount you donate, and the reward you choose, will
              not be made public.

              When your reward is ready, CCDG will send you a survey
              via email to request any info needed to deliver your reward
              (mailing address, T-shirt size, etc).
